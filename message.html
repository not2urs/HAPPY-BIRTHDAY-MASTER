        Hi Baby.... I want you to know that you hold the most special place in my heart and you are really special for me .You make me happy from heart.
        I have never felt this much happiness before. I like you a lot baby more than you know.  
        Your love wraps around me like the warmest hug. I love your smiLe, your smile is my favorite sunrise.
        I admire your strength, your kindness, your heart — the way you care, the way you dream, and the way you love me without holding back. You inspire me every single day to be the best version of myself.
        Being with you feels like home. It’s in your voice, your touch, your presence — a comfort I never want to live without. Thank you for being the most incredible partner, my best friend, and my forever person.
        I love you Babyyyyyyyyy.......❤️.
